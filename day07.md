# Day 07

## Faces - 2

Today I mainly added some variations to the face, trying to make it look more different from refresh to refresh.
Additionally they eyes received inner pupils which get random colours.

Adding all of these features was quite easy code-wise, however what has shown itself to be a challenge is the data-management.
Part of creating the face are a multitude of variables, sometimes local sometimes global, which get randomized and decide width, height, etc.

Having an overview of what these variables do is currently only possible because I coded everything, which is to say it's still fresh in my head.
Although a large code-reformatting is not in my best time-interest now it will probably be necessary if I continue designing my face generator.

The outcome of today feels very luke-warm, although I was able to add in a lot more variety, the code has exponentially grown in its jungle-ness.
This aspect of coding and design is also something I've struggled with continually in this module: A part of me wants to create code which is flexible 
and can be reused but another part realizes the vainness of it and tries to get "quick" results. This has made designing a lot more difficult as I
will often start thinking not from a perspective "what would look nice" but from a perspective of "how can I code this" which hampers creativity as I am not a God-coder.

Having said all this, enjoy the sketch:
Pressing "r" while having the sketch focused will recreate a new face.
