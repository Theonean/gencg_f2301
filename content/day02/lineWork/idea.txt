create n rows, and columns, 
iterate over "squares" in grid and sometimes place a sideways bar, sometimes not
animate it, they move the direction they point
bars become lighter they closer they are to the bottom 
-->visually the colours should "stay still" but the bars move, should be interesting

(a line could also be represented by something like a button? or text?!!??)
