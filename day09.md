# Day 09

## Collect / prepare

Today I improved upon my bounding box calculation, previously I was loosely calculating the bounding box.
Now, I am using the p5 collision2d Library and the p5js bezierPoints function to get accurate information about my face outline.
Implementing this I ran into quite a large problem which had me stumped for some time:
Problem 1: Collisionshapes are "filled" which i didnt realize

Additionally I reworked the way the head is placed to try and add more variation, however that did not work as intended so it was scrapped
additionally I got to work on a "frame" around the head to add more possible visual differences.
