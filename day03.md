# Day 03

## PacMan Clock

Part of todays challenge was to make something akin to a clock while refraining from using numbers or literal representations.

Although quite an interesting challenge I had a lot of trouble finding interesting ideas, often times finding myself coming back to round and cyclical representations. 

To try and break this way of thinking I tried a creative method of pulling stuff into the bizzare, this led to timed explosions (not doable in scope) or games automatically playing themselves in a beat (reminiscent of Crypt of the Necrodancer). 

Liking the games aspect I quickly thought of pacman and this evolved into a pac-clock:
With 3 segments representing hour:minute:second you can read the clock by how many balls have been eaten on the 12x12 grid.
The hour segment takes up two columns and the minute and second segments take up five columns respectively.

Due to troubles creating the movement of the pacman agents I couldn't find much time to add to the design value of this clock. After adding the animation (which still has bugs) the day was over and other parts of life started calling.
