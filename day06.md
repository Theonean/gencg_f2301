## Faces

Todays challenge was to make a face-generator or something akin to it.
As I had mainly stayed with the usable geometric forms (square, circle, rect, etc.) I wanted to give beziers a try.

For preparation I doodled some small and simple faces and tried to think of the various important positions or variables I'd have to save.
While drawing I quickly realized I could add some variations by adding eye / nose / mouth variations, so I drew some of those.

blabla I programmed, two facesides, funny results
THIS IS NOT DONE YET, FINISH MEEE
